PROJECT NAME: Self-Organizing Aerial Swarm Robotics for Resilient Load Transportation : A Table-Mechanics-Inspired Approach
========================================================================

1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Operating Systems: Windows or Ubuntu
* Software Dependencies: MATLAB
* Tested Versions: MATLAB 2023a
* Required Non-standard Hardware: None

2. INSTALLATION GUIDE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Instructions: Install MATLAB and then you are able to run the demo code

3. DEMO
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Instructions to run on data: Run the init file to obtain the simulation results.
* Expected Output: Upon execution, the program will automatically generate a video of multi-robot collaborative transportation.
* Expected Run Time: Tens of seconds

4. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How to run the software on your data: Currently, the simulation is initialized with a pre-defined set of random robot positions. However, users can specify any initial positions for the robots—within a physically feasible range—to execute customized lifting tasks
* Reproduction Instructions: The quantitative results presented in the manuscript are derived from statistical analyses of multiple simulation runs using the provided demo cases. Due to the randomized initial positions, the statistical results may exhibit minor fluctuations.
